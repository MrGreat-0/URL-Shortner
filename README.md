# 🔗 URL Shortener – Full Stack Project

This application is a full-featured **URL shortener** built with a modern MERN-style stack. It allows users to generate short, shareable links from long URLs — similar to services like Bitly or TinyURL.

- 🌍 **Public users** can create short URLs instantly without registration.
- 🔐 **Registered users** can log in to:
  - Create and manage their own short URLs
  - Use custom slugs (e.g. `/github` instead of `/Ab3kL2`)
  - View all their created links in a personal dashboard

The app includes **JWT authentication** stored in **secure HTTP-only cookies**, route protection using TanStack Router, and session-aware Axios interceptors. All URLs are stored in **MongoDB**, and redirection is handled via server-side Express routes.

| Layer     | Tech Stack                                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend  | React, Redux Toolkit, TanStack Router, Axios, Tailwind CSS |
| Backend   | Node.js, Express, MongoDB (Mongoose), JWT, bcrypt          |
| Auth Flow | Secure HTTP-only cookies + middleware + interceptors       |
| Routing   | Protected routes using `beforeLoad` + redirect logic       |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Backend

Make sure you have a `.env` file (see [Backend/README.md](https://github.com/MrGreat-0/URL-Shortner/blob/main/Backend/README.md) for setup)

---

### 💻 Frontend

```
Vite will launch on http://localhost:5173
```

Also make sure you have a `.env` file (see [Frontend/README.md](https://github.com/MrGreat-0/URL-Shortner/blob/main/Frontend/README.md) for setup)

### 🔐 Features

```
    ✅ User Registration & Login (JWT Auth with HTTP-only cookies)

    ✅ Create Short URLs (with or without login)

    ✅ View your links in Dashboard

    ✅ Protected route: /dashboard (redirects if not authenticated)

    ✅ Auto logout on session expiry (via Axios interceptor)

    ✅ Seamless redirection using /:slug route

    🚫 Rate limiting on URL creation (based on IP or user)

    ⏳ Expiration logic for short URLs (30 days for guests, 7 days for users)

    🧱 Friendly 404 and Expired Link Error Page (via EJS + frontend route)
```

### 🧠 Developer Tips

```
    All /me requests include a skipAuthRedirect flag on the frontend to prevent unnecessary logouts on public pages.

    Backend uses attachUser and authMiddleware to secure routes and associate links with users.

    Custom error classes like AppError, UnauthorizedError, and ConflictError help with clean backend error handling.

```

## 🧠 Developer Notes

- Error handling is unified:
  - Frontend handles unknown routes via `NotFoundPage.jsx`
  - Backend uses `error.ejs` to show expired or invalid short links
- Rate limiter is configurable per user/IP using `express-rate-limit`
- Expired short URLs are automatically deleted on visit

## ✅ TODOs / Ideas

- 📊 Add click analytics per shortened URL (IP, referrer, timestamp, etc.)
- 🔁 Add refresh token support for longer sessions
- 🛠️ Add admin panel to manage all links (view, delete, moderate)
